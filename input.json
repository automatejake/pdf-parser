Consider ","completing a new","Form W-4 each year and ","when your personal or","financial situation ","changes.","Exemption from withholding. ","You may ","claim exemption from withholding for 2018 ","if ","both"," of the following apply.","• For 2017 you had a right to a refund of ","all","federal income tax withheld because you ","had ","no"," tax liability, ","and","• For 2018 you expect a refund of ","all","federal income tax withheld because you ","expect to have ","no"," tax liability.","If you’re","exempt, complete ","only ","lines 1, 2, ","3, 4, and 7","and sign the form to validate it.

After your Form W-4 ","takes effect, you can also use this ","calculator to see how the amount of tax ","you’re having withheld compares to your ","projected total tax for 2018.
